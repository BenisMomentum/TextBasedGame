0 | You are sitting in on your couch. The TV in front of you as usual is displaying the latest news. Chaos...Social Decay...the norm. | EAST-1 | WEAPON/knife/COMMON/15/QUICKDRAW=5 PIERCE=0 | null
1 | You are outside on the sidewalk | NORTH-3 SOUTH-2 WEST-0 | null | null
2 | You are in the Slums. A derilict place of rampant crime and degeneracy, forgotten by most and avoided by all. | NORTH-1 WEST-6 | null | MONSTER/Homeless Man/5/0/10/10
3 | You are in the Park. Admittedly a very run down one, like your apartment complex, but on the bright side, it's sunny. | WEST-4 EAST-8 | null | null
4 | You're in a small plaza. Nothing Special. Just some stores, fast-food, drycleaning and a pharmacy. | EAST-3 NORTH-5 SOUTH-9 | HEAL_ITEM/Bandage/COMMON/10 / HEAL_ITEM/Bandage/COMMON/10 | null
5 | You are on a small bus stop. Leads to the City or the Slums. | EAST-2 WEST-10 | null | null
6 | You're deeper in the Slums. A mini Red-Light Disctrict. Broken used needles, passed out druggies...god help them | EAST-2 SOUTH-7 | null | MONSTER/Poverished Mugger/20/0/20/5
7 | You're in an abandoned apartment building...some bandits made it their resting stead. Seems like some good stuff is inside...lets hope they don't see you. | NORTH-6 | WEAPON/Pistol/UNCOMMON/30 | MONSTER/Bandit/30/0/15/5
8 | You're in a forgotten part of the Park. Overground brush and unpruned trees - nobody seemed to maintain them for a while, huh? | WEST-3 | null | null
9 | You're South of the Plaza, next to a bridge. Underneath it, there seems to be a homeless encampment. Guess the Slums aren't the only place for them... | NORTH-4 | null | MONSTER/Homeless Man/5/0/10/10
10 | You're in the city finally! Took the bus long enough. Lots of places to go, lots of things to do. Lots of shops as well. Fortunately you have enough money saved up...right? | NORTH-11 WEST-12 EAST-5 SOUTH-14 | null | null
11 | You're in Eden Plaza. Plenty of shops around. Some medical stores, some various clothing shops. Unfortunately you can't afford anything here besides food, and even that costs an arm and a leg. Luckily there's a Salvation Army as well, for broke people like you! | SOUTH-10 WEST-12 EAST-13 | ARMOUR/Thick_Jacket/COMMON/5/ / HEAL_ITEM/Tacos/COMMON/5 / HEAL_ITEM/Refreshing_Water/COMMON/10 | null
12 | You're in a small ocean-side park. Well, technically ocean-side, anyway. It's essentially an island with a road leading up to it that's surrounded by a river. The birds are chirping, you can see happy couples roaming by...how the years have left you. | EAST-11 NORTH-15 | null | null
13 | You're next to a Coffee shack, small and quaint for its setting in a massive city. The owner is busy serving other customers. Coffee's not a bad idea. | WEST-11 NORTH-15 SOUTH-14 | null | null
14 | You're down a road that leads to Downtown. Taking the bus would have been easier but it was full. | NORTH-10 WEST-16 SOUTH-15 | null | MONSTER/Drug Addict/5/0/10/10
