9 | HOMELESS BRIDGE | You're South of the Plaza, next to a bridge. Underneath it, there seems to be a homeless encampment. Guess the Slums aren't the only place for them... | NORTH-4 | null | MONSTER/Homeless Man/5/0/10/10 | RAYMOND

13 | COFVEFE SHACK | You're next to a Coffee shack, small and quaint for its setting in a massive city. The owner is busy serving other customers. Coffee's not a bad idea. | WEST-11 NORTH-15 | HEAL_ITEM/Coffee/COMMON/10 | null | MIKE
