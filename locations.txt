0 | HOME | You are sitting in on your couch. The TV in front of you as usual is displaying the latest news. Chaos...Social Decay...what happened to your dream? | EAST-1 | WEAPON/Bayonet/COMMON/15/QUICKDRAW=5 PIERCE=0 / REGEN_ITEM/BMRA/COMMON/3/4 | null
1 | SIDEWALK | You are outside on the sidewalk | NORTH-3 SOUTH-2 WEST-0 | null | null
2 | SLUMS | You are in the Slums. A derilict place of rampant crime and degeneracy, forgotten by most and avoided by all. Nothing was changed... | NORTH-1 WEST-6 EAST-5 | null | MONSTER/Homeless Man/5/0/10/10/null
3 | PARK | You are in the Park. Admittedly a very run down one, like your apartment complex, but on the bright side, it's sunny. | WEST-4 EAST-8 SOUTH-1 | null | null
4 | SMALL PLAZA | You're in a small plaza. Nothing Special. Just some stores, fast-food, drycleaning and a pharmacy. | EAST-3 NORTH-5 SOUTH-9 | HEAL_ITEM/Bandage/COMMON/10 / HEAL_ITEM/Bandage/COMMON/10 | null
5 | BUS STOP | You are on a small bus stop. Leads to the City (WEST) or the Slums (EAST). | EAST-2 WEST-10 SOUTH-4 | null | null

7 | BANDIT CAMP | You're in an abandoned apartment building...some bandits made it their resting stead. Seems like some good stuff is inside...lets hope they don't see you. | NORTH-6 | WEAPON/Pistol/UNCOMMON/30/PIERCE=1 | MONSTER/Bandit/30/0/15/5/RAGE=0,-10
8 | ABANDONED PARK AREA | You're in a forgotten part of the Park. Overground brush and unpruned trees - nobody seemed to maintain them for a while, huh? | WEST-3 | null | null
9 | HOMELESS BRIDGE | You're South of the Plaza, next to a bridge. Underneath it, there seems to be a homeless encampment. Guess the Slums aren't the only place for them... | NORTH-4 | null | MONSTER/Homeless Man/5/0/10/10 | RAYMOND
10 | CITY | You're in the city finally! Took the bus long enough. Lots of places to go, lots of things to do. Lots of shops as well. Fortunately you have enough money saved up...right? | NORTH-11 WEST-12 EAST-5 SOUTH-14 | null | null
11 | EDEN PLAZA | You're in Eden Plaza. Plenty of shops around. Some medical stores, some various clothing shops.

12 | STANLEY PARK | You're in a small ocean-side park. Well, technically ocean-side, anyway. It's essentially an island with a road leading up to it that's surrounded by a river. The birds are chirping, you can see happy couples roaming by...how the years have left you. | EAST-11 NORTH-15 | null | null
13 | COFVEFE SHACK | You're next to a Coffee shack, small and quaint for its setting in a massive city. The owner is busy serving other customers. Coffee's not a bad idea. | WEST-11 NORTH-15 SOUTH-14 | null | null | MIKE

18 | RIVER BANK | You're by a concrete river bank. You can see the vastness of the city in the background, to the left of you there's a bridge but it doesn't matter. A large tree overlooks the bank that seems...familiar | EAST-16 SOUTH-19 | null | null
19 | THE TREE | You're lying down by the tree. You remember that you were with someone here a long time ago; a friend...where is she? More importantly, is she alive? | NORTH-18 SOUTH-20 | null | null
20 | DOWNTOWN | You're Downtown. A scary place but nothing unfamiliar after how much has happened. Police sirens can be heard in the distance. | WEST-21 EAST-22 NORTH-14 SOUTH-23 | null | MONSTER/Drug Addict/30/0/10/10/null

22 | JOYCE ST | You're at a street called "Joyce"...why did you decide to stop here? | WEST-20 SOUTH-23 | null | null
23 | BAR | You're at the usual bar you go to after work...since you got fired over that bullshit there's not been much of a reason to come here...or go outside for that matter. It's almost closing time. | NORTH-20 | HEAL_ITEM/Kvass/COMMON/5 | null | KARLA
